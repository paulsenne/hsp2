    "In this original tutorial, this section demonstrated how Geographic Information System (GIS) information (like shapefiles) could be stored in the HDF5 file and used to draw interactive street maps overlayed with the shapefiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this demonstration required the user to install a fair number of Python GIS libraries (like geopandas and mplleaflet.) This made a simple installation of HSP2 and its Tutorials too complicated. (And all these libraries were only used in this one section!) So this orginal section was turned into the discussion below. Tutorial 6 does demonstrates using GIS information to analyze and check the watershed network. This requires putting fake GIS data into the test10 HDF5 file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Other Data in HDF5 Files (like GIS Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 can be used to store any data - not just numerical time series and tables. The documentation (such as PDF files) for a simulation can be conveniently stored in the simulation's HDF5 file. The Jupyter Notebooks used prepare the data and run the simulations can also be stored in the project's HDF5 file.\n",
    "This provides a complete archive of all important information to understanding the simulation requirements, data processing, and the simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIS data can be easily stored in an HDF5 file. The HDF5 file can allow tight integration between HSP2 and tools like QGIS by being a single \"database.\" For example, the shapefiles for each segment could be stored in a column in the operation's GENERAL_INFO table. Such information can allow enhanced watershed checking in HSP2. For example, the GIS system can calculate the area for each segment and store it in the GENERAL_INFO table. The AFACTR multipliers in SCHEMATC and NETWORK tables can be checked against these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, many of these libraries will become a core part of the scientific Python stack and not need separate installation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original Section and code \n",
    "is shown in the text cell below for users who would like to explore GIS. Although installing all the libraries is tedious, the code below shows the using GIS functionality is easy."
